Tower Turmoil
=============

A Global Game Jam 2015 entry by Gordon Brown, Shaun Campbell, Aaron Dron, and Andy Durdin.

Overview
--------

“What do we do now?” is the constant cry of my workers. Such a lazy bunch. They can’t even build me a tower taller than my arch-rival’s without me constantly telling them what to do next! Recruit four types of worker and race to build a powerful offensive tower. Win by having a large enough workforce to build your battlements and raise your flag!!

Requirements
------------

Requires Unity 4.6.1

Build for 1920x1080 screen resolution and two xbox 360 controllers. Using these controllers on Microsoft Windows requires the official Microsoft drivers. Using the controllers on newer versions of OS X may require this unofficial driver: https://github.com/d235j/360Controller/releases
